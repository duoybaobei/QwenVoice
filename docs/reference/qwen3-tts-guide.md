# Qwen3-TTS Reference Guide

A living reference for the Qwen3-TTS models that power Vocello (formerly QwenVoice). This document covers the model architecture, the three generation modes, the built-in speaker roster, emotion/delivery control, voice cloning, language handling, generation parameters, and the practical behaviors we have observed in the Swift + MLX implementation.

**When to update this file**

- Whenever `Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json` gains or changes a model variant, speaker, or generation default.
- Whenever `EmotionPreset.swift`, `GenerationSemantics.swift`, `NativeCloneSupport.swift`, or `VoiceDesignBriefCatalog.swift` change the prompt contract, preset copy, clone pipeline, or design briefs.
- Whenever we move the pinned `mlx-community` revisions or quantization tiers.
- Whenever benchmarking reveals new quality/latency/artifact behaviors.

**Source-of-truth hierarchy**

1. `Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json` — model IDs, repos, revisions, variants, tokenizer profile, generation defaults.
2. `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/*.swift` — runtime prompt construction, speaker/language logic, clone conditioning, preset definitions.
3. `Sources/SharedSupport/Services/VoiceDesignBriefCatalog.swift` — voice-design brief copy and limits.
4. This document and `docs/reference/mlx-guide.md` (for MLX/performance details).

## 1. What Qwen3-TTS is

Qwen3-TTS is an open-weights text-to-speech family from Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team. It is built around a single neural audio tokenizer (a Mimi-style RVQ codec) and an autoregressive "Talker" language model. The same family supports three distinct usage patterns:

- **Custom Voice** — 9 built-in preset speakers with optional natural-language style instructions.
- **Voice Design** — describe a voice in plain text and synthesize speech in that voice.
- **Voice Cloning** — clone a speaker from a short reference audio clip (≈3 s is enough; 10–20 s is the sweet spot).

All three patterns generate **24 kHz mono PCM**. Vocello ships only the **12 Hz tokenizer** variant; the faster 25 Hz variant mentioned in the technical report is not used.

---

## 2. Model families and variants

Vocello bundles three model families, each from the `mlx-community` Hugging Face organization and pinned to a specific revision in `qwenvoice_contract.json`.

| Family (mode) | Folder suffix | MLX repo suffix | Size | Platforms | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Custom Voice** (`custom`) | `…-CustomVoice-8bit` | `…-CustomVoice-8bit` | 1.7B | macOS only | Quality tier; supports instruction control. |
| **Custom Voice** (`custom`) | `…-CustomVoice-4bit` | `…-CustomVoice-4bit` | 1.7B | iOS + macOS | Speed tier; instruction control. |
| **Voice Design** (`design`) | `…-VoiceDesign-8bit` | `…-VoiceDesign-8bit` | 1.7B | macOS only | Quality tier; text-described voices. |
| **Voice Design** (`design`) | `…-VoiceDesign-4bit` | `…-VoiceDesign-4bit` | 1.7B | iOS + macOS | Speed tier; text-described voices. |
| **Voice Cloning** (`clone`) | `…-Base-8bit` | `…-Base-8bit` | 1.7B | macOS only | Quality tier; requires speaker encoder. |
| **Voice Cloning** (`clone`) | `…-Base-4bit` | `…-Base-4bit` | 1.7B | iOS + macOS | Speed tier; requires speaker encoder. |

- **8-bit = Quality**, **4-bit = Speed**. macOS defaults to Quality unless the device is in the `floor8GBMac` memory class, in which case Speed is selected. iOS always uses the Speed variant.
- Qwen3-TTS also publishes **0.6B** checkpoints. Vocello currently pins only the **1.7B** variants.
- `supportsInstructionControl` is `true` for Custom Voice and Voice Design, `false` for the Base clone model.
- `requiresSpeakerEncoder` is `true` only for the clone model.

---

## 3. Architecture

The pipeline has four parts. All numbers below are for the **1.7B** variant unless noted.

```text
Text  →  Qwen BPE tokenizer  →  Text embedding + projection  →  Talker (28-layer transformer)
                                                                        ↓
                                                           Codebook-0 / semantic token per frame
                                                                        ↓
                                              Code Predictor (5 layers × 15 passes) → codebooks 1-15
                                                                        ↓
                                              16 discrete codes per 80 ms frame
                                                                        ↓
                                              Speech Tokenizer Decoder (Mimi-style RVQ) → 24 kHz PCM
```

### 3.1 Audio representation (tokenizer profile)

The canonical profile is defined once per model capability block in `qwenvoice_contract.json`:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Sample rate | 24,000 Hz |
| Frame rate | 12.5 Hz (80 ms per frame) |
| Decoder quantizers | 16 |
| Encoder valid quantizers | 16 |
| Encoder configured quantizers | 32 (training config; inference uses 16) |
| Per-quantizer codebook size | 2,048 |
| Semantic codebook size (contract) | 4,096 |
| Effective bitrate | ~2.1 kbps |
| Compression ratio | ~1,920× vs. raw 24 kHz PCM |

Each frame is therefore a vector of 16 integers in `[0, 2047]`. The first codebook carries the most semantic content; later codebooks add prosody, speaker identity, and acoustic residuals.

### 3.2 Talker (main LM)

| Parameter | 1.7B | 0.6B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text hidden size | 2,048 | 2,048 |
| Talker hidden size | 2,048 | 1,024 |
| Layers | 28 | 28 |
| Attention heads | 16 | 16 |
| KV heads (GQA) | 8 | 8 |
| Head dimension | 128 | 128 |
| Q dimension (heads × head dim) | 2,048 | 2,048 |
| Intermediate FFN size | 6,144 | 3,072 |
| Position encoding | M-RoPE, θ = 1e6, interleaved | same |
| M-RoPE section | `[24, 20, 20]` | `[24, 20, 20]` |
| Norm | RMSNorm (ε = 1e-6) | same |
| Activation | SwiGLU (SiLU) | same |
| Text projection | SiLU MLP: 2,048 → 2,048 → hidden size | same |

Key implementation details:

- Q and K are **per-head RMSNorm'd** before RoPE.
- RoPE is **interleaved** (adjacent pairs), not NeoX split-half.
- For TTS, all three M-RoPE position dimensions are identical, so it behaves like standard RoPE.
- The Talker predicts tokens from a separate **codec vocabulary** of size 3,072, not the text vocabulary.

Special token IDs (codec vocabulary):

| Token | ID |
| --- | --- |
| `codec_pad` | 2,148 |
| `codec_bos` | 2,149 |
| `codec_eos` | 2,150 |
| `think` | 2,154 |
| `no_think` | 2,155 |

Language IDs are also codec-vocabulary tokens, e.g. English = 2,050, Chinese = 2,055. Vocello's `Qwen3SupportedLanguage` enum maps these at runtime.

### 3.3 Code Predictor (multi-token prediction)

A 5-layer transformer that runs **15 sequential passes** per frame to predict codebooks 1 through 15, conditioned on the Talker's hidden states and previously predicted codebook tokens. Each pass has its own embedding and head:

- `talker.code_predictor.model.codec_embedding.{g}` for g = 0…14
- `talker.code_predictor.lm_head.{g}` for g = 0…14

This means ~103 layer evaluations per 80 ms frame (28 Talker + 75 Code Predictor + decoder), or roughly **1,288 layer evaluations per second of output audio**.

### 3.4 Speech Tokenizer Decoder

A Mimi-based neural codec decoder that converts the 16-code frames back to a 24 kHz waveform. It is causal and streaming-friendly:

- 8 pre-transformer layers
- 7 convolutional decoder blocks with Snake activation
- 2 ConvNeXt upsampling blocks
- Final tanh → float samples in `[-1, 1]`

All speech-tokenizer weights are shipped as **F32**, even when the Talker is quantized to 4/8 bit.

### 3.5 Speaker encoding (voice cloning)

There are **no separate speaker embedding tensors**. In Custom Voice, the 9 speakers are represented as tokens in the codec vocabulary (e.g. `serena` maps to a specific codec ID). In Voice Cloning, a small speaker-encoder network consumes the reference audio and produces a reusable `Qwen3TTSVoiceClonePrompt` that conditions the Base model at inference time.

---

## 4. Built-in speakers

The 9 preset speakers are defined in `Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json`. Each has a native language and a short description. The model-specific config (`talker_config.spk_id`) is the runtime source of truth for which speakers a checkpoint actually supports.

| ID | Display name | Native language | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aiden` | Aiden | English | Sunny American male voice with a clear midrange. |
| `ryan` | Ryan | English | Dynamic male voice with strong rhythmic drive — naturally expressive. |
| `vivian` | Vivian | Chinese | Bright, slightly edgy young female voice. |
| `serena` | Serena | Chinese | Warm, gentle young female voice. |
| `uncle_fu` | Uncle Fu | Chinese | Seasoned male voice with a low, mellow timbre. |
| `dylan` | Dylan | Chinese (Beijing dialect) | Youthful Beijing male voice with a clear, natural timbre. |
| `eric` | Eric | Chinese (Sichuan dialect) | Lively Chengdu male voice with a slightly husky brightness. |
| `ono_anna` | Ono Anna | Japanese | Playful Japanese female voice with a light, nimble timbre. |
| `sohee` | Sohee | Korean | Warm Korean female voice with rich emotion. |

- The default speaker is `aiden`.
- Speaker quality is best when the target text is in the speaker's native language, but all speakers can generate any of the 10 supported languages.

---

## 5. Generation modes

### 5.1 Custom Voice

Use a built-in speaker and optionally steer delivery with a natural-language instruction.

```swift
Qwen3PromptAssembly(
    mode: .customVoice,
    text: "Hello, welcome to Vocello.",
    language: "english",
    instruct: "Speak happily and energetically.",
    speakerID: "aiden"
)
```

- Instruction control is **only available on the 1.7B CustomVoice model**. The 0.6B model (not shipped in Vocello) does not support it.
- For English text, `GenerationSemantics` appends a diction-reinforcement clause (`Native English pronunciation with clear English diction and natural stress.`) unless the instruction already contains diction-related words or the feature is disabled via `QWENVOICE_ENGLISH_DICTION_REINFORCEMENT=off`.
- Celebrity imitation / voice impersonation instructions are rejected by `validateQwenPromptContract`.

### 5.2 Voice Design

Describe the voice in plain text; the model samples a new voice matching the description.

```swift
Qwen3PromptAssembly(
    mode: .voiceDesign,
    text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    language: "english",
    instruct: "Voice character: A deep, low-pitched male narrator, warm and bass-resonant. Delivery: Calm and soothing.",
    speakerID: nil
)
```

- Voice Design is **1.7B only**.
- The brief (voice description) is limited to **500 characters** in the UI (`VoiceDesignBriefCatalog.descriptionLimit`).
- There is **no fixed speaker ID**. Each call samples a fresh voice, so consistency across sessions requires the **design-then-clone** workflow (see below).
- Effective descriptions are concrete and acoustic: name gender, age, pitch register, pace, timbre, emotion, and use-case. Avoid abstract persona-only prompts.
- Accent/dialect hints are flavor, not guarantees.

### 5.3 Voice Cloning

Clone from a reference audio clip.

```swift
Qwen3PromptAssembly(
    mode: .voiceClone,
    text: "Hello, this is my cloned voice.",
    language: "english",
    instruct: nil,          // Base model ignores instructions
    refText: "Reference transcript.",
    speakerID: nil
)
```

- Requires the **Base** model and the speaker encoder.
- A transcript (`refText`) improves quality but is optional. Vocello also accepts a sidecar `.txt` file next to the reference audio.
- The Base model **does not follow delivery/emotion instructions**. To get a styled clone, use **design-then-clone**: generate a styled reference clip with Voice Design, build a clone prompt from it, then generate with the Base model using that prompt.

### 5.4 Design-then-clone workflow

This is the recommended way to create a reusable, styled character voice:

1. Use **Voice Design** to synthesize a short reference clip that matches the desired persona and delivery.
2. Call `createVoiceClonePrompt(refAudio:refText:)` to build a reusable `Qwen3TTSVoiceClonePrompt`.
3. Use the Base model's `generate_voice_clone(voice_clone_prompt=...)` for all subsequent lines.

Vocello caches the resulting clone prompt on disk and in memory to avoid recomputing it for every generation.

---

## 6. Delivery / emotion presets

`Sources/QwenVoiceCore/EmotionPreset.swift` defines the single source of truth: **12 presets × 3 intensities**.

| Preset | subtle | normal | strong |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `neutral` | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| `happy` | Hint of warmth | Happy and upbeat, smiling | High pitch, loud, fast, bright, without laughing |
| `sad` | Quiet reflective sadness | Heavy, restrained, lowered pitch | Fragile, tearful, slow, clear words |
| `angry` | Quiet irritation | Firm, sharp consonants | Forceful tension, not screaming |
| `fearful` | Quiet unease | Anxious, breath caught | Trembling panic, still audible |
| `surprised` | Mild pitch lift | Pitch jumps, quick, astonished | High rising pitch, amazed, no gasping |
| `whisper` | Gentle close-mic whisper | Hushed, breathy, confidential | Urgent, barely voiced, secretive |
| `dramatic` | Measured theatrical weight | Heightened inflection | Sweeping grandeur, generous pauses |
| `calm` | Relaxed and warm | Smooth, unhurried, reassuring | Serene, meditative stillness |
| `excited` | Touch of enthusiasm | Bright, animated | Fast, driving, ringing, no laughing/shouting |
| `narrator` | Relaxed storyteller | Documentary warmth, crisp diction | Rich gravitas, deep timbre, slow |
| `news` | Light news-desk | Clear broadcast style | Prime-time anchor, brisk, crisp |

Prompt-writing lessons baked into the preset copy:

- **Concrete acoustic wording** (pitch, pace, timbre, volume) is followed more reliably than persona-only wording.
- **Negative constraints work** (`"joyful but without laughing"`).
- **Stacked intensifiers do not work** (`"very very very happy"` adds no value).
- High-arousal instructions (`happy`, `excited`, `surprised`) can otherwise trigger literal laughter or extra breath sounds; the strong tiers explicitly forbid that.
- An intelligibility clause (`"keeping every word audible"`) helps bound extreme emotions.

---

## 7. Language handling

### 7.1 Supported languages

`Qwen3SupportedLanguage` enumerates 10 languages plus `auto`:

`chinese`, `english`, `japanese`, `korean`, `german`, `french`, `russian`, `portuguese`, `spanish`, `italian`.

### 7.2 Language hint selection

`GenerationSemantics.qwenLanguageHint(for:resolvedCloneTranscript:)` decides which language token is sent to the model:

- **Custom Voice**: detect from the target text; fall back to `english`.
- **Voice Design**: detect from the target text; fall back to `auto`.
- **Voice Clone**: detect from the resolved transcript if available, otherwise from the target text; fall back to `auto`.

Detection order:

1. Japanese kana → `japanese`
2. Hangul → `korean`
3. Cyrillic → `russian`
4. CJK → `chinese`
5. Latin script → `PromptLanguageDetector` (NLLanguageRecognizer) to disambiguate French/German/Spanish/Portuguese/Italian/English; if confidence is too low, `auto`.

Official guidance: **explicit language tokens outperform `auto`**. Vocello therefore tries to detect and only falls back to `auto` when ambiguous.

### 7.3 Dialects and accents

- Two built-in speakers carry Chinese dialect hints: `dylan` (Beijing) and `eric` (Sichuan/Chengdu).
- Voice Design prompts can request accents, but the model treats them as suggestions, not guarantees.
- Cross-lingual generation works (e.g. an English-native speaker speaking Chinese), but native-language combinations usually sound most natural.

---

## 8. Voice cloning pipeline

Implemented in `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/NativeCloneSupport.swift`.

1. **Reference normalization**
   - Compute a SHA-256 fingerprint of the source file.
   - Convert to canonical 24 kHz mono WAV if needed.
   - Mirror a sidecar `.txt` transcript if present.
   - Cache the normalized result with LRU eviction.

2. **Transcript resolution**
   - Inline transcript from the UI/CLI.
   - Else sidecar `<audio>.txt`.
   - Else `nil` (the model can still clone from audio alone, but quality drops).

3. **Reference decoding**
   - Load the normalized WAV into an `MLXArray` at the model's sample rate.
   - Cache the decoded array.

4. **Quality warnings**
   `referenceQualityWarnings` checks the normalized reference and returns tokens:

   | Token | Meaning | Severity |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `reference_duration_short` | < 10 s | Soft warning |
   | `reference_duration_long` | 30–60 s | Soft warning |
   | `reference_duration_excessive` | > 60 s | **Hard block** — voice cannot be kept |
   | `reference_sample_rate_noncanonical` | Not 24 kHz | Soft warning |
   | `reference_channels_noncanonical` | Not mono | Soft warning |
   | `reference_near_silence` | RMS < 0.0005 | Soft warning |
   | `reference_possible_clipping` | Peak ≥ 0.98 | Soft warning |
   | `reference_quality_unreadable` | Could not read file | Soft warning |

   The recommended reference window is **10–20 seconds of clean speech**.

5. **Clone prompt creation**
   - If a transcript exists and the model supports optimized cloning, call `createVoiceClonePrompt(refAudio:refText:xVectorOnlyMode: false)` for ICL-backed cloning.
   - If no transcript exists, call `createVoiceClonePrompt(refAudio:refText:nil,xVectorOnlyMode: true)` for the speaker-only audio fallback. This is lower guidance than transcript-backed cloning, but it must remain usable.
   - The resulting `Qwen3TTSVoiceClonePrompt` is cached in memory and persisted to disk (under `voicesDirectory`) keyed by model ID, reference fingerprint, transcript hash/mode, and language.
   - Re-use the same prompt across multiple generations to avoid recomputing speaker features.

---

## 9. Generation parameters

The runtime defaults are a stack of three layers:

1. **Checkpoint defaults** (`generation_config.json`): `max_new_tokens = 8192`.
2. **Wrapper fallback** (`Qwen3GenerationConfiguration.wrapperFallbackMaxNewTokens`): 2048.
3. **App policy** (`qwenvoice_contract.json` / `Qwen3GenerationConfiguration.officialQualityDefault`): 2048.

Vocello's effective defaults:

| Parameter | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_new_tokens` | 2048 | App policy |
| `temperature` | 0.9 | App policy |
| `top_k` | 50 | App policy |
| `top_p` | 1.0 | App policy |
| `do_sample` | true | App policy |
| `repetition_penalty` | 1.05 | App policy |

The **Code Predictor** uses greedy sampling (`temperature = 0`, `top_k = 1`) in the reference implementation; Vocello follows the same convention.

Streaming:

- `appStreamingInterval = 0.32` s (configurable, used to batch decoder output into user-facing chunks).
- PCM preview data is emitted by default on both platforms (`QWENVOICE_STREAMING_PREVIEW_DATA=emit`).

## 10. Performance and memory

For Apple Silicon-specific optimization guidance (Metal, unified memory, KV cache, quantization, `eval`/streaming, MLX cache clearing) see [`mlx-guide.md`](./mlx-guide.md). This section covers Qwen3-TTS-specific numbers.

### 10.1 Compute budget

At 12.5 frames per second of audio:

| Component | Evaluations per frame | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Talker | 28 layers × 1 pass | Q/K RMSNorm, M-RoPE, GQA 2:1 |
| Code Predictor | 5 layers × 15 passes | One pass per residual codebook |
| Speech decoder | 8 pre-transform + 7 conv + 2 upsample | F32 weights; smaller matrices |
| **Total** | **~103 layer evals/frame** | ~1,288 layer evals/second of audio |

### 10.2 Latency

Official reference numbers (CUDA, torch.compile, CUDA Graph):

| Model | First-packet latency | RTF (real-time factor) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.6B | ~97 ms | — |
| 1.7B | ~101 ms | 0.313 |

Apple Silicon MLX numbers depend heavily on quantization tier, model size, text length, and memory pressure. Use Vocello's built-in telemetry (`QWENVOICE_NATIVE_TELEMETRY_MODE=verbose`) to capture per-generation memory curves.

### 10.3 Variant selection and memory classes

`ModelDescriptor.preferredVariant` selects:

- **iOS**: Speed (4-bit).
- **macOS 8 GB**: Speed (4-bit) to stay within the `floor8GBMac` memory policy.
- **macOS 16 GB+**: Quality (8-bit) by default.

Model download sizes (approximate, from `qwenvoice_contract.json`):

- 4-bit: ~2.3 GB
- 8-bit: ~3.1 GB

---

## 11. Known limitations and behaviors

These are compiled from the official docs, community reports, and Vocello's own QA pass.

- **No instruction control on Base clone model.** If you need a styled clone, use design-then-clone.
- **Voice Design has no fixed speaker.** Each call samples a fresh voice; reuse requires building a clone prompt.
- **Accent/dialect control is suggestive, not deterministic.** It works better for broad language-native speakers than for fine-grained regional accents.
- **Conflicting descriptions fail.** `"high-pitched deep bass voice"` will produce unpredictable results.
- **High-arousal emotions can add sounds.** The preset copy explicitly forbids laughing/gasping in strong tiers.
- **Reference audio sweet spot is 10–20 s.** Shorter clips work (the paper claims 3 s rapid clone) but may be less consistent. Over 60 s is blocked.
- **Music and noise are not the model's strength.** The tokenizer is optimized for clean speech; noisy or musical references degrade.
- **Celebrity/voice impersonation requests are rejected** by the prompt validator.
- **Long outputs can hit the 2048-token app cap.** If generation truncates, the finish reason will be `max_tokens`.
- **Latin-script language detection can be ambiguous.** When in doubt, set the language explicitly in the UI.
- **25 Hz checkpoints exist** but Vocello does not ship them; this guide covers only the 12 Hz tokenizer.
